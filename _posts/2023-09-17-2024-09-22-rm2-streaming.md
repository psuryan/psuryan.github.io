Stream your reMarkable tablet's screen directly to your Mac using a USB connection. This setup allows for real-time screen sharing without relying on Wi-Fi.

## Setting Up SSH Access Over USB

1. **Connect reMarkable to Mac via USB**
   - Use your USB C cable to connect the reMarkable tablet to your Mac.

2. **SSH into reMarkable**
   - Open **Terminal** on your Mac.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     ssh root@10.11.99.1
     ```
   - **Password:** Enter your SSH password. However, you can login without password by following the instructions [here](https://remarkable.guide/guide/access/ssh.html#connecting-over-usb).  

## Installing goMarkableStream on reMarkable

See detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream) but the steps that I used are the following.

1. **Download the goMarkableStream Binary**
   - On your Mac, visit the [goMarkableStream Releases](https://github.com/owulveryck/goMarkableStream/releases/tag/v0.18) page and download `goMarkableStream_0.18_linux_arm.tar.gz`. Change release numbers appropriately. At the time of writing it was `0.18`.

2. **Transfer the Binary to reMarkable**
   - In **Terminal** on your Mac, execute:
     ```bash
     scp goMarkableStream_0.18_linux_arm.tar.gz root@10.11.99.1:/home/root/
     ```

3. **Extract the Package and Set Permissions**
   - SSH into reMarkable if not already connected:
     ```bash
     ssh root@10.11.99.1
     ```
   - Extract the tarball:
     ```bash
     tar xvzf goMarkableStream_0.18_linux_arm.tar.gz
     ```
   - Set executable permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x /home/root/goMarkableStream_0.18_linux_arm/goMarkableStream
     ```

## Configuring goMarkableStream
1. **Create a Shell Script** 
    ```bash
    pushd /etc/systemd/system
    touch goMarkableStream.service

    cat <<EOF>goMarkableStream.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Go Remarkable Stream Server

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/home/root/goMarkableStream_0.18_linux_arm/goMarkableStream
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF

    systemctl enable goMarkableStream.service
    systemctl start goMarkableStream.service
    systemctl status goMarkableStream.service
    popd
    ```
2. **Run the Setup Script**
   - Execute the setup script:
     ```bash
     sh setupGoMarkableStream.sh
     ```
   - **Service Status:** Verify that the service is active:
     ```bash
     systemctl status goMarkableStream
     ```
     You should see:
     ```
     Active: active (running)
     ```

3. **Change Default Credentials**
   - **Edit the Service File:**
     ```bash
     nano /etc/systemd/system/goMarkableStream.service
     ```
   - **Add Environment Variables:**
     Under the `[Service]` section, add:
     ```ini
     Environment="RK_SERVER_USERNAME=your_username"
     Environment="RK_SERVER_PASSWORD=your_password"
     ExecStart=/home/root/goMarkableStream_0.18_linux_arm/goMarkableStream
     ```
     Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your desired credentials.
   - **Save and Exit:** Press `Ctrl + O`, `Enter`, then `Ctrl + X`.

4. **Reload systemd and Restart the Service**
   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart goMarkableStream
   ```

## Accessing the Stream on macOS

1.	Open a Web Browser on Your Mac
2.	Navigate to the Streaming URL: http://10.11.99.1:2001
3. 	Enter the username and password you configured earlier.

Open any document notebook on the reMarkable and you should be able to view it in the URL above.
